Hi there 👋 I'm Victoria, a Technical Communication student, barista, and real estate assistant. My only experience with coding is a tiny bit of HTML in high school, so this is all pretty much new to me!

I'm definitely a homebody and like to spend my downtime reading, playing video games, doing crosswords, and hanging out in the backyard with my plants and cats. 🌱:cat:
