Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Victoria, a Technical Communication student. My only experience with coding is a tiny bit of HTML in high school, so this is all pretty much new to me!

Besides school, I work at Starbucks and am a real estate assistant on the side. I'm a homebody and like to spend my downtime reading, playing video games, doing crosswords, and hanging out in the backyard with my plants and cats.
